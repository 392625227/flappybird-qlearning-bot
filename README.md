# Flappy Bird Bot using Reinforcement Learning in Python

A Flappy Bird bot in Python, that learns from each game played via Q-Learning.

**bot.py** obtains the class that applies the Q-Learning logic.  
  
  
**flappy.py** is the pygame clone of Flappy Bird, that I adjusted to be played by the bot.( Originally from https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird )
  
**qvalues.json** is a JSON file that contains the all the states and their Q-values. (work-in-progress)
